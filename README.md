I have covered few things on both Unit and Integration testing to ensure a quick look on JUnit+Spring Boot.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing is a procedure to test individual unit of a large source project whether specific part is working properly or not.

**Few Advantages**
- It helps to fix bugs earlier.
- Provides high-quality code.
- It improves a developer's coding skills.


### Integration Testing
Integration testing is one type of software testing in which different components, units of an application are tested together.

**Few Advantages**
- It ensures that different integrated components or units are working as expected.
- Improves test coverage and provides reliability.
